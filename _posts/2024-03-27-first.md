## Non-decreasing order:
>This refers to an arrangement where each element in an array or sequence is either greater than or equal to the preceding element. In other words, while the array or sequence may not be fully sorted, each element should be greater than or equal to the preceding one. 
>>This allows for consecutive elements with the same value in the array.


## Increasing order:
>This refers to an arrangement where each element in an array or sequence is strictly greater than the preceding element. In this case, the array or sequence must be fully sorted, with each element being strictly greater than the preceding one. 
>>This implies that consecutive elements with the same value are not allowed in the array.


#### In summary, "non-decreasing order" allows for elements to remain the same or increase, while "increasing order" strictly requires elements to increase without staying the same.
